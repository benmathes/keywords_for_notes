# Tag Keyphrases in a Directory


**For** people with lots of bare text files.

**Who** want to auto-tag the prominent
phrases for graph-based note taking tools like [NVAlt](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/)
and [Roam](http://roamresearch.com).

**It is** a python shell script.

**That** uses Natural Language Processing tools to automatically tag for you.

**Unlike** manually tagging what you find important, this script is much faster.

**However** it won't be as good as if you tagged the key phrases in your notes yourself.





### What it does

Scans a directory, recursively, for text files, and adds the double-square brackets (`[[`) that
graph-based network tools


## Example

    # lets assume I have a '~/notes' folder with hundreds of text files of notes
    > python tag_keywords_phrases.py ~/notes
